    <!--The <p> tag is a block-level element, and the align="center" attribute, when applied to it, will center its inline content. Since the <img> tag is an inline element by default, it will be centered within the paragraph.so that is why we cant use the align attribute to center the image and to center it we have to use <p> or <div>-->
